    <p>Welcome to my ultimate documentary and biography collection—a handpicked mix of the fascinating, the eye-opening, and the downright jaw-dropping! Now, don’t get me wrong, I love a good serial killer story as much as the next person (and trust me, there are plenty out there), but I decided to give them a pass this time and focus on some other gems. Whether you're into nature, history, true crime (but not the typical stuff), or inspiring personal stories, there's something here for everyone. I hope you find something new to binge!</p>
